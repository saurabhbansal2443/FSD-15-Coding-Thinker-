// Var vs Let vs Const

// reintialization -> Var can be reinstialized but let and connot  cannot be

// Value declartion and change -> var and let can be changed const cannot be 
// Note-> when intializing the const variable we have to give the value 


// Var can be access before it has been decalred let , const  cannot be accesssed before intilaization 

// Hoisting - variable and function are moved to top of the scope prior to execution
